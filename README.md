# StreamLite-YoutubeClone

This is my Final Year BS(CS) Project. It consists of a youtube clone created with asp.net mvc and sql server database. It has almost all the features of youtube.

# Features:
1. login/signup (manual/facebook login), change password, forgot password.
2. Channel creation.
3. Unlimited playlist creation (update, delete).
4. Upload videos with video compression of H265 or HEVC working at the back end either to channel only or within a playlist.
5. Single video display with like, dislike, report video, comments (view, add, delete, update), add to watch later, display of related videos.
6. Channel and video search functionality.
7. Update channel details.
8. Liked videos (view, remove individual video likes).
9. Watch History (delete single video from watchlist, delete entire watchlist).
10. Playlist video page to view all videos in a playlist.
11. User guide.

# Video Comparision before and after compression:

# Limitations:
Due to advanced video compression technology i.e Hevc or H265 this project will only display videos on microsoft edge.
